# Railway Management
Railway Management System in CPP. This is my 3rd semester engineering project in cpp.

Here I have implemented a small railway management application in C++ language.

### C++ Version
It runs of C++11 or more than that standard.

### Development Environement
This developement of it was done in windows 10 pro using VS Code.
In VS Code I used various c++ extensions by microsoft in order to debug quickly.

Also it was complied and tested using g++ compiler by [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) . You may use other C++ compilers also ! (Testing has not been done)

### How to startup this project
In order to start this project you first need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [g++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed in you system.

Then run the following commands.
```shell
$ https://github.com/The-4th-Hokage/railway-management.git
$ cd railway-management
$ if ($?) { g++ main.cpp -o main } ; if ($?) { .\main }
```

### Scopes
There are many scopes of improvement in this project like cheaking of seats no, automatically assigning a seat no then view all the bookings and many more.

### External Libraries
Various external libraries have been used to ease the work, their licenses have been provided in their folder (where it is stored).
